# What is this?
We want to provide mlrMBO as a service. This server wraps the R package `mlrMBO` along with some software management software in order to handle multiple users simultanously. We expose a REST API, which will be documented somewhere in this repo.

# How to use this?
TBD, but the server will likely run in a docker container.

# May I use this?
We provide both the server application as well as the reference client library as Open Source under the MIT license. This basically means you can use both the server and the client in open source and commercial projects.
