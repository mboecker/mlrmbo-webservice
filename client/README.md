# What is this?
We want to provide mlrMBO as a service. This client provides a high-level interface to the mlrMBO-Server provided in this repo. Without installing machine learning packages or other software (except of this package), you can benefit from mlrMBO!

# How to use this?
Install the R package with devtools (`devtools::install_github("mboecker/mlrmbo-webservice/client");`) and use according to package API (TBD).

# May I use this?
We provide both the server application as well as the reference client library as Open Source under the MIT license. This basically means you can use both the server and the client in open source and commercial projects.
